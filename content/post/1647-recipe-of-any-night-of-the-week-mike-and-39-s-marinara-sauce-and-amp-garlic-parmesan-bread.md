- "● Chop your vegetables.                                                       ● Place everything in the Marinara Sauce section in a large pot and simmer on medium heat for about an hour and a half. Stir intermittently.                                                                                                            ● Remove bay leaves after simmer."
- "● Generously smear your bread with garlic butter and sprinkle tops with Dried Parsley and Parmesan Cheese.                                                                                        ● Bake rolls at 350° for 8 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                         ● Pile your Marinara Sauce on thick, sturdy pieces of garlic parmesan bread, or, dip toasted garlic strips directly into it."
