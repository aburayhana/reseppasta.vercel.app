recipeinstructions:
- "Authors Note: Traditionally, marinara sauces will direct you to cook your chopped vegetables in olive oil until translucent prior to adding them to your sauce. This recipe does not call for that step. It&#39;s meant to keep some snap, body and texture in your sauce."
- "● Chop your vegetables.                                                       ● Place everything in the Marinara Sauce section in a large pot and simmer on medium heat for about an hour and a half. Stir intermittently.                                                                                                            ● Remove bay leaves after simmer."
- "● Generously smear your bread with garlic butter and sprinkle tops with Dried Parsley and Parmesan Cheese.                                                                                        ● Bake rolls at 350° for 8 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                         ● Pile your Marinara Sauce on thick, sturdy pieces of garlic parmesan bread, or, dip toasted garlic strips directly into it."
- "If you&#39;d like to make this a main pasta dish as opposed to an antipasto - this is a great truffle noodle that pairs excellent with this mushroom based Marinara Sauce."
