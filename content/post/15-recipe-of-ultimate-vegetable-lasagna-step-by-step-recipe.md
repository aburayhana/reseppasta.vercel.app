Spread some roasted veggies and spread. Then pour in some white sauce and again spread. Finally spread in some cheese. Repeat the layering process thrice."

If you want your cheese to be a little brown just broil it for 1 minute at 230°C (Pleas don&#39;t move away during broiling)  Once done, let it cool for 15 minutes and then cut a slice and Enjoy!"
