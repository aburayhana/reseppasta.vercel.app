- " For the pasta"
- "100 g cooked beetroot"
- "400 g semolina"
- "100 ml water"
- " For the sauce"
- " Sprouting broccoli"
- "2 anchovies fillets"
- " Olive oil"
- "2 cloves garlic"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by cooking the beetroot in a pot in boiling water and salt. Add the beetroot and leave it to cook for 45 minutes to an hour"
- "When the beetroot is ready, peel it cut it into smaller pieces and mix it in a mixer until it becomes a smooth paste. Add water (no more than a cup) to help turning it into a paste."
- "To make the pasta add the beetroot to the semolina and mix well. Then add the water and mix. I made mine in the kitchen aid but if you do it by hand start with the classic vulcano shape for the semolina and add the liquids into it slowly mixing it in taking from the edges. Leave to rest for 30 min"
- "In the meantime prepare the sauce. The classic recipe is from Puglia and is meant to be with orecchiette and the broccoli are meant to be boiled. I roasted mine because I think it gives it a nicer flavour but up to you. Cut the broccoli into small pieces and roast on 150 for about 10-15 min"
- "When 30 min have passed take the pasta and make into thin rolls of about 1cm in diameter. You can spread your fingers to make the roll more even and faster (as per video below)"
- "You can then cut the pasta about 1.5/2cm length, just take a length and stick with it as they will cook at different times otherwise"
- "To then make the cavateli shape you’ll need to take each piece of pasta and with 2 fingers press the pasta until it makes a hole and make it curl onto itself (video)"
- "Put on water to boiled ready for the pasta with a handful of rock salt. In a frying pan add the garlic thinly minced and some olive oil. Don’t let it burn. Add the anchovies until they melt. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes."
- "When the broccoli are ready add them to the pan with the garlic and anchovies."
- "Cook the pasta in boiling water for about 6-8 minutes. Hand made pasta with semolina tends to stay quite al dente but do taste it to ensure that it’s ready. Add the pasta to the pan and mix well. Serve hot. No cheese should be added when there is fish but in the traditional recipe they used breadcrumbs instead cooked in the oil and anchovies so if you have it you can try that."
- "If you have leftover pasta you can keep it in the fridge in a Tupperware for about 4 days or alternatively you can lay down on a dish separated from each other and put them in the freezer. When they are completely frozen put it into a bag sealed it and keep it in the freezer for about six months. You won’t need to defrost it before cooking just put them in boiling water and cook for 8–10’"
