recipeingredient:
- " For the pesto you will only use 12 to 23 of this and the rest is great in a Caprese salad or stirred into pasta"
- " Small bunch basil"
- "Handful rocket"
- "Handful spinach"
- "40 g nuts"
- "1 tsp water"
- "1/2 lemon juiced"
- "3 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 large garlic cloves"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- " For the tart"
- "1 pack ready rolled puff pastry 375g"
- "1 large courgette"
- "100 g asparagus"
- " Couple of spoonfuls of Caramelised Onion Chutney or 1 red onion sliced thinly and caramelised over a low heat with 2 tsp butter 2tsp brown sugar and 1 tsp balsamic vinegar"
- "Handful cherry tomatoes halved"
- "100 g Feta cheese"
- "1 small egg or 1 tbsp milk as a wash"
- " Black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C."
- "Use a vegetable peeler to make the courgette into ribbons. Peel on 4 sides until you reach the seedy middle which should be in a cuboid shape (this is perfect to add to soups, pasta or omelettes)."
- "Sprinkle with a small layer of salt."
- "Cut the asparagus lengthways so they are about 5mm thick (usually in half but may need to be in thirds)."
- "Blend together the pesto ingredients until smooth, bright green. Adjust to taste."
- "Lay out the puff pastry sheet on a baking sheet with the attached baking paper."
- "Spread half the pesto in a layer over the puff pastry, leaving a border. You shouldn’t be able to see any pastry below the pesto so use more if needed."
- "Pat the courgette dry and, without breaking the ribbons, try and remove as much liquid as possible."
- "Lay the asparagus over the pesto then lay the courgette ribbons in waves all over the tart. Some should be sticking upright and some laying down to give different textures."
- "Dot the halved tomatoes around the tart and then drizzle or spray olive oil over the surface."
- "Do an egg or milk wash over the border and then bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown on the edges and underneath. Sprinkle the feta over after 15 minutes. You may need to put foil over the edges if they are browning too quickly."
- "Crack some black pepper over the top and then cut into 4 pieces. Serve warm!"
