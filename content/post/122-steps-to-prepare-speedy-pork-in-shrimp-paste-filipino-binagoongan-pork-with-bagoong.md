Slice the chili is you want heat.  Add salt according to your taste. If you used salty shrimp paste, you might not need to. You might need to add a pinch of sugar instead.   Mix well and remember not to over cook the veggies :)   Remove bay leaves. Garnish with chopped green onion. Serve and enjoy."
