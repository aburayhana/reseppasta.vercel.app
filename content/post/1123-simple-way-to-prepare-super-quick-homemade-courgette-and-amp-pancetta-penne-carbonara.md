recipeingredient:
- "200 g penne pasta"
- "2 large freerange egg yolks"
- "50 ml single cream"
- "handful grated pecorino cheese"
- " olive oil"
- "2 small courgettes ideally fairly thin"
- "100 g pancetta cut into lardons"
- "1 garlic clove crushed and chopped optional"
- "a few thyme or basil leaves"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put a large pan of salted water on to boil."
- "If you have thick courgettes, you&#39;ll want to cut them down by either halving or even quartering them lengthways. Then slice them into pieces similarly sized to the penne."
- "Add the penne to the boiling water and cook according to packet instructions. I prefer to aim for al dente!"
- "To make the carbonara sauce...  Separate the egg yolks and put them in a bowl. Discard the whites. (I sometimes use the eggs whole, but yolk-only is the traditional way!)  Add the cream and grate in half the pecorino cheese. Mix together with a fork.   Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and put to one side for later."
- "Heat a large frying pan and add a splash of olive oil. Fry the pancetta until dark brown and crisp. (I personally like to fry them with a bit of garlic, but this is very much not traditional!)"
- "Add the sliced courgette to the frying pan. And add a pinch or two of black pepper."
- "This is an important step to get right...  When the pasta is cooked, drain it, and reserve some of the cooking water. (I like to catch some of the water by putting the colander on top of a mug while I drain.)  While the pasta is still very hot (be quick!), toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes and bacon. Then quickly remove from the heat, add a little bit of the reserve pasta water, and add the carbonara sauce. Stir together quickly. Keep it moving and do not let the eggs set/scramble."
- "While tossing the pasta, add a little more of the grated pecorino. (Retain the rest of the pecorino for serving on top of the pasta.) At this stage also consider adding some more of the reserve water if the pasta&#39;s not silky enough."
- "Serve the pasta into dishes. Add grated pecorino on top (as per your guest&#39;s preferences), cracked black pepper, and sprinkle your favourite green herbs on top (basil or thyme)."
