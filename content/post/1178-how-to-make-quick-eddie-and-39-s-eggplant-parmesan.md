recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat Oven to 350F, slice up eggplants, and spray a metal cooking tray with non-stick spray (Tall sides needed)."

- "When the pasta is almost finished, open up the oven and sprinkle the shredded Parmesian over the centents of the pan. Put back in so it can melt, and turn off the oven (but keep the oven closed so it is melting the cheese)."
- "Once the pasta is ready and the cheese is melted, you are ready to eat! Place the meat on one side of each plate, and serve the sauce/eggplant/tomato mixture over the pasta."
