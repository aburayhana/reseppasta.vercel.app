Slice sun dried tomatoes into 1/4&#34; slices. There are two types of sun dried tomatoes-soft and hard.

Add butter (allow it to melt) then add lemon juice, capers, and cover. Turn heat down to medium low and cook for about 2 minutes. Do not overcook squash. They shouldn&#39;t be soft.

What better way to get your veggies in than with a savory Italian dish like Pasta Primavera. My version combines a little bit of heat from red pepper flakes with fresh vegetables. The key to pasta primavera is using the freshest vegetables available. Mix this vegetable and pasta dish in a large Dutch oven or pasta pot. The primary pasta primavera pitfalls are oversized and undercooked vegetables and long strands of spaghetti slipping through your fork.
