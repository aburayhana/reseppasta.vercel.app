Combine salmon with creamy cheese and let it melt on your palette -add pasta and a beach and it&#39;ll taste as good as a holiday. In winter, frozen sockeye salmon is an excellent choice. The tart, silky red fruit is a great foil for salmon, and the wine&#39;s minerally herbal quality plays off the salsa verde. Smoked salmon with pasta in a sauce of shallots, garlic, white wine, lemon, and cream, with toasted pine nuts and parsley. What I love about this recipe, other than the ingredients (smoked salmon, pine nuts, yum!) is that it can be pulled together so quickly and it&#39;s not.
