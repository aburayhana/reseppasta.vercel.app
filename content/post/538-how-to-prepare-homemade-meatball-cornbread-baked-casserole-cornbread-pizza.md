This casserole also reheats very well, and it is great the second time around. I hate cooking and I&#39;m not very good at it but your video inspired me and I made it. It&#39;s one of my top three favorite recipes of yours (Pizza casserole and turkey meatballs over mashed cauliflower). After a quick simmer, the casserole gets topped with the cornbread batter and goes into the oven so that the chili gets some more simmering time and the cornbread bakes up with a nice crust on top. Serve with your favorite chili toppings; I&#39;m partial to cheese and sour cream, but some scallions and.
