recipeinstructions:

- "Add the Cumin, Coriander, Red Chilli, Rajma masala, Garam masala powders, Salt and cook for a further 5 minutes. Once you start getting a faint aroma of the masalas add the Rajma (without the water) and sauté for another 7 – 8 minutes till the masala becomes really dry."
- "I cooked the Rajma for on a medium flame till they were soft and completely in tune with the masala that they were coated in. It took me around 15 – 18 whistles. Sprinkle the fresh Coriander on top."
