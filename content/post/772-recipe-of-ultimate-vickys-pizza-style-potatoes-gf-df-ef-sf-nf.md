recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 6 / 200C / 400°F"
- "Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, brush with 1/2 a tablespoon of the oil and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake until tender, around 1 - 1 &amp; 1/2 hours. You can also bake in the microwave on full power for 7 - 12 minutes depending on the wattage. Mine take 10 mins at 800W"

- "Preheat the grill / broiler. Halve the potatoes, transfer to a baking dish cut side up and top with the vegetable mixture.

- "For the marinara, place the tomatoes, tomato paste, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper in a blender and blitz until smooth. Saute the finely chopped onion in olive oil for 2 minutes in a large frying pan. Add the blended tomato sauce, basil and white wine. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
