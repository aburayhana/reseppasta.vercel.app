recipeingredient:
- "1 whole Savoy cabbage"
- "500 g pork mince can use other meats this is just my preference"
- "1 small handful of chopped green onions"
- "1 onion mincedfinely diced"
- "2 large garlic cloves mincedfinely diced"
- "1 medium carrot thinly slicedcut with mandoline"
- "1/2 red bell pepper finely diced"
- "1 teaspoon minced ginger"

- " Wateroiloil alternative optional"
- " Tangy tomato dip"
- "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce"
- "1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste"
- "1 teaspoon soybean paste"
- " Add water until your desired thickness"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the onions in a pan (use oil or an alternative, when they get warm I like to add water to prevent burning) until soft. Then remove and allow to cool"
- "Add all the ingredients into a bowl and mix until well combined."
- "Cover bowl in cling film and put in the fridge to marinate for 1 hour to a couple days (you can do it as long as you feel, I ended up doing it for 2 days but I originally planned to do it for one)"

- "Boil water in a pan/pot and cook the cabbage to soften them a bit (they won&#39;t all fit at once, but that&#39;s not a big problem) for about 5 minutes. Then remove and allow to cool slightly. (I put them in one of the steamers so they drained a little more)"
- "(optional) slice the stem of the cabbage off slightly to make them easier to roll. To do this position your knife at a slight angle and slowly slide it down to the end of of the cabbage."
- "Take a chunk of the marinated mix and wrap it in a cabbage leaf, a bit like a burrito. Fold the back and sides over and roll."
- "V^v^v"
- "Place in a steamer (I do the big ones in one pan and try and organize it by size). Steam until cooked through. Big ones about 15-20 minutes, small ones about 5."
- "Take out of the steamer, let sit for a couple minutes so they don&#39;t burn your mouth off, and serve (the 3 dips I did were little homemade ones that I made up, ones tangy tomato, ones a concoction of spy sauce, honey etc and the other is the same as the latter but with spice)"
