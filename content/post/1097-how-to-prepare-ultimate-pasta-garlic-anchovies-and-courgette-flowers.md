I have eaten courgette flowers at restaurants a few times, but had never seen them for sale in their raw, unadulterated purity. It is unlikely that you I eat them roasted, char-grilled, stewed in ratatouille, and sauteed with plenty of garlic as a simple pasta sauce. I had never cooked the flowers before. Stir in the anchovies, capers and red pepper and cook for a half-minute more, then Drain the pasta and return it to the pot.
