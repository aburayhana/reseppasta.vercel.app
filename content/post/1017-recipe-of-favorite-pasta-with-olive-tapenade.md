The meaty umami of the olive tapenade is the clear star of the show in this dish. When paired with a simple pasta, a good salty cheese, and a drizzle of olive oil it forms a simple but satisfying powerhouse. I was flipping through Nigel Slater&#39;s Real Fast Food the other day in a bookstore, and it fell open to this recipeâ€”which wasn&#39;t really a recipe but a casual suggestion for tossing pasta with olive tapenade. I decided to run with it, creating this adaptable dish using Kalamata olives, capers, a bit of dried.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pasta with olive tapenade:

1. Take 1 boiling water
1. Make ready 1/2 lb pasta of your choice

This blend of olives, garlic, oil, and vinegar is a sharp and tangy spread for breads, breadsticks, and vegetables, and the perfect meze to bring out the best in ouzo or wine. I always make sure I have some ingredients on hand so that I could whip up a pantry pasta whenever my fresh groceries are dwindling, and this is a great example of one that uses almost all non-perishable ingredients. While the pasta cooks, put the olives, olive oil, garlic, parsley, capers, lemon juice, and oregano in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Appetizers and starters are often more difficult to plan than main meals.

Appetizers and starters are often more difficult to plan than main meals. After all, you want the entree to be tasty, but not ruin any appetites; complement, but not take over the flavors of the main and if you&#39;re only serving appetizers, like when you&#39;re having a party, you want the. I used a Mediterranean olive mix, which worked fine. If you&#39;re dumb like me and but olives with pits in them, just use a meat mallet to whack the olive and the pit comes right out!
