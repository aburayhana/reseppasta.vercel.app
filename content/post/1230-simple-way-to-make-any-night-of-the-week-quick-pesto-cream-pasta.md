##### The ingredients needed to make Quick Pesto Cream Pasta:

1. Get  Pasta of choice
1. Prepare  Heavy cream, Ok half-and-half or whole milk will work too
1. Take  Basil Pesto
1. Make ready  Parmasen cheese
1. Get  Oil (if making pasta ahead of time)


Do NOT substitute half-and-half for the heavy cream if you want a thick sauce. Heat heavy whipping cream and water in a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat until hot but not boiling. After mixing in the Pesto I felt that the sauce was still too thin and I didn&#39;t think it would stick well to the pasta. You can use the pesto immediately, store it in the fridge for a few days, or a great way is to freeze it to use at a later date.
