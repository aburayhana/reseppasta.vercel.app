recipeinstructions:
- "While the water comes to a boil, prepare the cabbage! Only remove the tough looking stem from the cabbage, as seen in the photo."
- "Cut the cabbage into triangles. Cutting into triangles will help it cook evenly and the leaves will naturally round out with the heat."
- "After the cabbage has been cut, heat some oil in a frying pan and cook on medium heat!"
- "Add 2-3 cm of water to the pan and cover with a lid!"
- "This is how they should look. When the cabbage is cooked, it brings out the sweetness and tastes so good~ Remove the cabbage onto a separate plate."
- "This is the point to the pasta this time! Add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of bonito soup stock granules to the boiling water! The flavor of the water will be absorbed by the noodles."
- "Adjust the heat so that the water is gently boiling. Boil the noodles 2 minutes shorter than recommended on the package."
- "Heat the pure olive oil in a frying pan. Cook the sakura shrimp on low heat until fragrant."
- "Add 1 ladle of the boiling pasta water and the shio-kombu. Mix it together at this point."
- "Drain the pasta, save the water. Once the pasta has cooked, add it to the frying pan directly from the water. Since they will be cooked some more in the frying pan, it&#39;s okay if the noodles are a little hard still."
- "Add the cabbage."
- "Stir it around and around. At this point, add some boiling pasta water bit by bit as needed to make the noodles al dente."
- "Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, blend it in, and it&#39;s done."
